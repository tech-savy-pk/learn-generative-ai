- Click "OK" on all open windows to save your changes.

6. **Close and Reopen Powershell:** Close the Powershell window and open a new one.

7. **Verify Installation:** In the new Powershell window, type poetry --version and press Enter. If Poetry has been successfully installed, you should see its version number printed in the terminal.

You have now successfully installed Poetry on your Windows system. You can start using it for managing your Python projects.
